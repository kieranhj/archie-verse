Verse-chorus-verse. Aka Into the Archie-Verse.
~~~
An Archimedes demo framework.
Contains all accumulated libraries and code from previous prods.

Framework TODOs as of 15/5/24:
~~~
=> Add logo on screen and submit as blank framework. - DONE
- Separate tick/draw order from being tied together.
- Improve build using Tom's Python scripts and makefile-foo.
- Does ErrorV actually do anything?
- Move png2arc to Python 3.
- MOD file analyser to configure code / script.
- Move scripting to use seconds throughout?
- Create text-pool module from code in fx/bits.asm. - DONE
  (but could still maybe do with some refactoring)
- Automatic clearing of BSS by loader?
And as of 6/6/24:
- Remove OS_Byte VDU calls - just manage screen buffer data internally.
  No point in keeping these if poking VIDC directly for palette as not compatible.
  Keep a list of screen buffer addresses and set MEMC on vsync etc.
- Dynamically generate CLS code include clear line code.
- How have I got this far without memcpy and memclr?!
  Write optimised versions of these for lib.



ArchieKlang Announcetro
~~~
=> Like the oscilloscope view more when all channels are combined together.
    Kinda want this to fade?

Try?
- Lines not dots (expensive?) - DONE
- Previous buffers plotted above/below in darker colour to fade out? - DONE
- Use a Y buffer so they don't overlap? - DONE
- Add palette fade as lines move up.
- Custom faster line algo. - DONE
- More lines but with smaller amplitude - DONE
- Add 'zero' signal left and right of the wave lines - DONE
- Add header text - DONE
- Fade in header messages at the top (separate colour)
- Add iterator to header?
    - Looks meh. :\
- Simple scroller at the bottom? - DONE
    - Use RISCOS font? Corpus is fixed width (but might look meh?)
    - Still need to figure out how to draw at the same Y pos for all glyphs. - DONE
    - (Write a word with ascenders and descenders then grab the max height)
    - Still need to work out which Y to plot at though! - DONE
    ==> This is not going to work even with fixed width font due to kerning.
    ==> Either use a traditional font or plot one word at a time from the scrolltext... - DONE
    ==> Make a rough calculation of how much RAM this would be... - A LOT :)
- Move scroll text to own code module and separate from text_pool API - DONE
- Sort out outline_font vs text_pool APIs - LATER
    - Separate paint to screen from copy from screen to sprite.
    - Something like:
        outline_font_paint_to_screen
        sprite_utils_make_from_screen (copying in row or column order)
        remove use of text_pool by outline_scroller.
    => AM I MAKING THIS MORE COMPLICATED? JUST ADD THEM AFTER AND STORE THE ENTRY NUMBER SOMEHOW?
       NEXT TIME: Sort out text pool vs sprite pool etc.

- Have sequence start by fading in 'BITSHIFTERS' 'ALCATRAZ' 'present' etc. - DONE
    - Then start scroll text in the same slot.
- Possible to slow the scroller down? - DONE
    - Scroll rows one byte at a time in sw and just plot right hand columns?
    - What about double/triple buffers? - JUST DOUBLE
- Add ArchieKlang sample gen at some point! - DONE
- Plot samples as they're generated? Use same effect?
    - Plot and move after each one? Hmmm!

TO FINISH
~~~
- Add fade to static header text. - DONE
- Add dynamic speed control to the scroller, otherwise it's a bit monotonous.
- Add some nice colour palette fades across the track. - IN PROGRESS
- Get the final tune?!?!?! (Probably last minute... ;) => Rhino!
- Final scrolltext => get a few words from Virgill & Rhino. - DONE
- What to do about audio filter mod? => Steve?!
- BUG: Check first frame glitches ==> loader to zero BSS? No, already zero'd. Hmm.
- BUG: Wave peak leaks into fixed scroller area and gets dragged... - HACK IT! :)
- BUG: Base line drawn in colour 14 at offset 0 => flickers with certain palettes - DONE
- BUG: First frame sometimes displayed before palette is set - race condition?
- Add control code for additional spaces in scroller?
- Fade out at the end rather than loop for compo?

BONUS
~~~
- Generate any repeated code at runtime, e.g. cls, scroller shifts.
- Multiply scale of each line by a dynamic value. - STARTED
    - sin(camera a) so can 'look down' on the scope waves / contours.
        => dynamically changing the scale looks nice and emphasizes the y buffer effect.
        => doesn't have the effect of tilting the view 'towards' the camera.
           Need to run through the perspective equation.
           Can't really do a divide per Y value. Well....
    - sin(ypos - centre) so looks like it rotates around a cylinder.
    - Could do different scale per line.
- Remove divide call from arcmusic - it's always 32767/const - DONE
- Use a proper modulo fn. for scope scroll, not a loop. - DONE
- Try having the live waveform NOT moving with the others? - DONE
- Does it look better without the flat lines on the left/right? => small border looks best.
- Dynamically cut down version for ARM2 machines? Party version can be 12MHz. - DONE AS COMPILE OPTION FOR NOW
    - Fewer samples => doesn't have much effect on overall perf => linedraw bound.
    - Fewer lines => biggest impact.
    - Need to change scopes to 8/14 :(
    - Probably also shrink text size
    - Actually switching to 32 samples for the waveform but keeping the dx=4
      makes the waveform part smaller and looks cool enough!
      Can reduce scopes to 11/11 or higher!
- Dynamically set sample speed for ARM2/ARM250+ machines for highest quality.
    - DONE AS COMPILE OPTION FOR NOW

Line segment drawing.
dx is fixed == 4 (or whatever)
dy limited: -128 <= dy <= 127
Line segments are connected.

Use MODE 12.
Unroll all 256 possible code paths.
Just do Bresenham, steep and shallow paths with
x+=1:y+=0 => strb r4, [r11], #1
x+=1:y+=1 => strb r4, [r11], #-ScreenStride+1
x+=1:y-=1 => strb r4, [r11], #ScreenStride+1
x+=0:y+=1 => strb r4, [r11], #-ScreenStride
x+=0:y-=1 => strb r4, [r11], #ScreenStride
